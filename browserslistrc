# .browserslistrc
#
# Tells Angular's esbuild compiler which browsers to target.
# Without this, Angular 17+ defaults to ES2022 output — which
# crashes on iOS 16.0–16.3 (Safari 16.0–16.3) because those
# versions are missing ES2022 class static initialization blocks.
#
# Adding iOS >= 14 forces the output down to ~ES2019/ES2020,
# which all modern iOS devices support.
